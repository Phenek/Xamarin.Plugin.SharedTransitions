Activate shared element transitions between pages in Xamarin.Forms (IOS/Android)


#### What is a shared element transition?
They are Animations connecting common elements from one page to the next/previous.<br>
A shared element transition determines how elements that are present in two pages transition between them.
For example, an image that is displayed on both Page A and Page B, transitions from A to B when B becomes visible.
Transitions in apps provide visual continuity, connecting common elements from one page to the next.
